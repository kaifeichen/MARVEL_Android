## Privacy policy

This app is designed to collect information for a research study at the University of California, Berkeley. The study is being led by Kaifei Chen <kaifei@berkeley.edu>.

The goal of this study is to show how a robust smart phone based image localization system can be used to augment human building interactions.
This app allows users to point their smartphone camera to an appliance to identify and interact with it.
To achieve this, we collect smartphone camera images and other sensor data to provide a fast and accurate estimation of the 3D location and orientation of the phone.
The collected data will be saved and used to improve the system.
At the moment of writing, all communications to our server are over GRPC and not encrypted. We plan to add authentication and encryption later.
